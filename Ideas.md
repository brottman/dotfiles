I'm getting errors trying to run the manage script on the other machines that is not brian-laptop:

MarkupError: Expected markup style value (found '!][/red]').

NOTE: 1 of 2 errors shown. Run with textual run --dev to see all errors.







the tabs have a blue active tab indicator under them. I don't want this. I just want a plane seperator line.
